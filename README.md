# Welcome to my portfolio


## Introduction


Hello, i'm happy to present you my portfolio. This is part of my final evaluation during my training at the Wild Code School. I had to develop a website with a frontend and backend (authentification, MVC, database) during 2 days.

As this is an important project for me, I'll be keeping the portfolio regularly updated and improving it.

## üéØ The Objectives

My goal was to create a portfolio to help me in my search for a work-study placement, while at the same time working on a project that would enable me to improve on certain aspects of the backend in particular.

The aim was to have something viable to present to potential recruiters, despite the two days of coding!


## Front-End
Make a wireframe
Write user stories
Responsive Website
Dynamic Website
User (register, login, logout)


## Back-End
Create data & database
Components to data'access
MVC Schema
Authentification (register, login, logout)

# üõ†  Technical Stack

- HTML/CSS
- ReactJS
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- MySQL
- Material UI

# Installation

## Follow these steps

- In VSCode, install plugins **Prettier - Code formatter** and **ESLint** and configure them.
- Clone this repo, enter it
Run command `npm run setup`
Run command `npm run migrate`
_NB: To launch the backend server, you'll need an environment file with database credentials. You'll find a template one in `backend/.env.sample`_
Create `.env` files in /frontend and /backend following `.env.sample` examples.

 ## Another commands :

    - `setup` : Initialization of frontend and backend, as well as all toolings
    - `migrate` : Run the database migration script
    - `dev` : Starts both servers (frontend + backend) in one terminal
    - `dev-front` : Starts the React frontend server
    - `dev-back` : Starts the Express backend server
    - `lint` : Runs validation tools, and refuses unclean code (will be executed on every _commit_)
    - `fix` : Fixes linter errors (run it if `lint` growls on your code !)

# Packages

I used the Wild Code School - FullStack - Template

## It contains :
    - _Concurrently_ : Allows for several commands to run concurrently in the same CLI
    - _Husky_ : Allows to execute specific commands that trigger on _git_ events
    - _Vite_ : Alternative to _Create-React-App_, packaging less tools for a more fluid experience
    - _ESLint_ : "Quality of code" tool, ensures chosen rules will be enforced
    - _Prettier_ : "Quality of code" tool as well, focuses on the styleguide
    - _ Airbnb Standard_ : One of the most known "standards", even though it's not officially linked to ES/JS
    - _Nodemon_ : Allows to restart the server everytime a .js file is udated



## And I added :
    - React Router Dom
    - Material UI
    - Swiper
    - jsonwebtoken
    - cookie-parser
    - @emailjs/browser
    - styled/components
    - Argon2 - as a hashing password manager
    - React-toastify
